# Gameplay
Main player picks a verb or a verb phase.
Other players ask questions replacing the verb with Coffee Cup and the main player responds with yes, no, or elaborates if the answer is not completely yes or no.

For example, main player picks the word running.
Player 2: "Do you need legs to coffee cup?" Main player answers "yes."
Player 3:"Can you coffee cup in water?" Main player could answer "generally, no"
Player 4: "Do you need to be in shape to coffee cup?" Main player could answer "yes, if for large amounts of time"

This process continues until the players figure out the word.
