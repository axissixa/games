# Setup
Set up two pairs of two beer bottles: each pair is a frisbee-width apart, and the pairs are 10 meters apart, all four forming a really long rectangle. Some people _demand_ you cover your bottles in shiny tape. In the center of the rectangle place the cup.

The four people split into two teams of two. You stand with your partner by one pair of bottles that become your bottles.

Please shake hands to initiate cordial rivalry with your opponent.

# Gameplay
Each round starts with the cup a third full of beer. All players have to stand behind their bottles until the offense releases the disk, which starts the round.

## Offensive Play
The offending team has two roles: thrower and macker.

The thrower tries to knock over the defense's bottles. If one is knocked over, they are to run to the disk and from where it comes to a rest, try to knock over (only) their own bottles in a return throw. If no bottles are knocked over on the initial throw, the round ends immediately. One point is awarded per bottle knocked over by the thrower.

The macker is allowed to mack the return throw into the offense's bottles and can pass the disk back to the throwerfor more retries until the defense ends the round.

## Defensive Play
The defending team has two roles: drinker and caller.

The drinker is the primary defensive player. As soon as they touch the disk in the air or on the ground (but not while it is in the offense's hand), the round is over. They have to run to the cup once the offense relases the disk and drink the beer as quickly as possible if the offense knocks over a bottle. They are only allowed to face forward and can't move forward or backward from where they start drinking until the beer is finished. They _are_ allowed to wave their hands and move side-to-side while drinking to attempt to hit the disk. Once the beer is done, they can move freely in an attempt to touch the disk and end the round. If the offense does not knock over a bottle on the initial throw, the drinker does not have to finish the beer, since the round is over with no points scored. The drinker should refill the beer at the end of the round.

The caller helps out the drinker while they are drinking by saying which direction the drinker should lean while their back is to the thrower during the initial return throw.

## Role Rotation
After each round, teams alternate playing offense and defense. Players swap roles on offense after every throw. Players swap roles on defense only after the round ends due to the disk being touched by the defense.

# Endgame
First team to 21 points wins.

Please shake hands to terminate cordial rivalry with your opponent.

# Variations
* Veteran's: if the disk is not caught in the air on the retry throw, the round is over.
