# Setup
One person is picked to be _It_.
They leave the room and everyone else in the group comes up with three _tasks_ for It to complete.

Tasks should be physical actions:

- Take the milk out of the fridge and pour a little in a cup.
- Build a tower out of the pillows in the room.
- Flush some cinnamon down the toilet.

Once three tasks are agreed upon, It is invited back into the room, but nobody tells them what the tasks are.

# Gameplay
When It returns to the room, everyone is silent.
The only way the group communicates what tasks It should perform is by cheering them on.
Cheer "yay" loudly when It starts moving towards or performing parts of one of the tasks to reinforce that behavior.
Become silent if the action It is currently doing does not help them complete a task.

Once It has completed a task, everyone applauds and guides It to complete the next task.
