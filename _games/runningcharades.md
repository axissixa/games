# Setup
Create a list of ten clues, usually oriented around a theme for simpler play. Set up the groups in teams of 4-7 people.

# Gameplay
Take all your teams and put them in separate areas enough that they cannot interfere or see each other too much but enough so you can place someone equidistant between them.

One person now takes their list of ten clues and sits equidistant between the two teams. They are responsible for giving out the clues in order.

Each team sends an emmissary to get the first clue. It is now a race! Race back and get your team to guess the correct clue. The person to call out the answer must then run to the cluemaster and get the next clue.

# Winners
First team to win all 10 clues wins the game! Game repeats with another set of clues from any other player. Usually alternating beween teams.
