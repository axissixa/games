# Setup
Prepare the **sword**:
Take the stick and wrap about 4 inches on one end in tape.
This taped end is the **handle**.

# Gameplay
All throws and catches are _one handed_.
People take turns tossing the sword to a **recieving** person.
The reciever succesfully **catches** the sword if they catch the stick one handed with at least one finger touching the handle.
They also can **pass** and not move to catch the sword at all.

If the reciever doesn't succesfully catch the sword, then they **lose an arm**.
The first arm lost is the arm used to catch the sword, the second is one of your legs, the third is the other leg.

# Winners
Once you've missed three times, you'll have lost all of your arms and you're out.
Keep playing until one person is standing.
